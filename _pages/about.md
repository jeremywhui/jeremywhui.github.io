I am an adaptive and highly motivated computer engineering and computer science student at Rutgers Honors Academy. 

I have a large passion for studying security and algorithms, as well as teaching others the effects of computer science on everyday life. I was a former architecture security researcher in the [Princeton Intel REU](https://seas-reu.princeton.edu/). I was also a former lead teaching assistant for Introduction to Computer Science, as well a learning assistant for Introduction to Computers for Engineers, where I have supported many students through office hours and creating interactive learning experiences for students. I am particularly interested in studying the security of systems, particularly memory and computer architecture security.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
